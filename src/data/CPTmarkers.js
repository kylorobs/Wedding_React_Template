Coming out of Kalk bay you reach the harbour where fisherman still come in here during the day and lay out their fish on old brick tables near the water. This is where I learnt how big tunas are and that you have to take the ‘poo pipe’ out of prawns. Its also where I had my first drink with Trevor and Wendy – I had a Long Island Ice Tea accompanied by my first oyster – which was obviously vile and probably not the best choice of meet the boyfriends parents foods. Stroll around and look in all the little shops. There are some interesting clothes shops, trinckety homeware type shops and great cafes. This is also where I go in search of a hair braid every holiday - you are never too old and there is a lovely lady with dreads who will chat away and tell you about people watching in Kalkies!. There is an old antique shop full of crap in my opinion but Kyle likes a browse. We spend many an hour in here when he and Matt were sourcing props for both ‘Finding Grahamstown’ and ‘…’.Try any flavour in the ice cream shop and pop your head into the old door at the side of the Olympia Bakery. It doesn’t look so clean but you can see into the kitchen some days and everything is delicious."
